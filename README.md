## Summary 
The goal of this project was to create a travel app using Google Maps that would provide users the ability to get important information on over 700 of the top travel cities. The app would provide potential travellers the ability to retrieve and analyze weather data for their trips. Additionally travellers would be able to retrieve hotel information near cities they plan to travel to. The travel data would be displayed using a map overlay for ease of use. 


Each marker on the map when clicked will allow users to access the city's country, max temperature, current weather, as well as nearby hotel information.

Travellers could also use the app to select nearby cities to obtain directions to help them plan the travel itinerary
